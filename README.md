# TFG Idris2 playground
This repo serves as a playground to learn and understand Idris2 and how it can
be used in my bachelor's dissertation.

## Main file
This file will be used to connect the many different sub projects and will run
them.

## Parser
It is a validator more than a parser for Spanish DNI number. It is structured in
such a way that dependent types and linear types verify that it validates
according to the specification.
